                    Albert Einstein was a German-born theoretical physicist who developed the 
                    theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum 
                    mechanics). His work is also known for its influence on the philosophy of science. 
                    He is best known to the general public for his mass–energy equivalence formula 
                    E = mc2, which has been dubbed "the world's most famous equation". He received the 
                    1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to theoretical physics, and especially 
                    for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect", a pivotal step in the 
                    development of quantum theory.

                    Near the beginning of his career, Einstein thought that Newtonian mechanics was no 
                    longer enough to reconcile the laws of classical mechanics with the laws of the 
                    electromagnetic field. This led him to develop his special theory of relativity 
                    during his time at the Swiss Patent Office in Bern (1902–1909). However, he realized 
                    that the principle of relativity could also be extended to gravitational fields, and 
                    he published a paper on general relativity in 1916 with his theory of gravitation. He 
                    continued to deal with problems of statistical mechanics and quantum theory, which led 
                    to his explanations of particle theory and the motion of molecules. He also investigated 
                    the thermal properties of light which laid the foundation of the photon theory of light. 
                    In 1917, he applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the 
                    universe.
